### My interests

### Fun fact about me
- 😲My name, 'Anh', means 'older brother' in Vietnamese. This is one of the most commonly used names in my homeland. Therefore, people often call me by my last and my midle name so that they won't get me confused with others. However, the full name 'Ngoc Anh' is a bit long and takes time to write when texing, so my friends shortened it to 'Na'. 
- 🧪Interestingly, this nickname is the same symbol as the sodium element in Chemistry, 'Na'. So, I can say I have a 'link' with this subject! Moreover, my birthdate if December 11th, while sodium's atomic number is also 11 🧪.
